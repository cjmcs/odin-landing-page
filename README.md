# odin-landing-page

Consolidation of learning from The Odin Project's Flexbox curriculum. 

This is my second attempt at the project due to revisiting the flexbox content after struggling with the project first time around.

For this project we were given a pictorial example of how the website should be structured and styled. We were also provided a style guide. both can be found within the **brief** folder within this repo.
